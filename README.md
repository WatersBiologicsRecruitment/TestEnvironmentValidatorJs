**# Test Environment Validator for JavaScript**

1. Install Node v14.18.1 and NPM v6.14.15 (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We recommend the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to simplify switching between node versions.

2. Run `npm install` to download all dependencies needed to run the code.

3. Run `npm test` and check all the tests pass (you should see the output *1 spec, 0 failures*).
